# vue-crash-todolist

Running through the 2019 [Traversy tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy9q22isx3U) to compare to Vue3

This is a simple todo project, where the use can add a todo. It shows up in a list. User can check 'completed' and the text appears crossed out. They also have the option to delete the todo by clicking a red x. (commit 9f040e069b744f)

Added a JSON Placeholder fake API and routing. ()
